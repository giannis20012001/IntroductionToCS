""" christmas.py
Prints a christmas tree on the terminal using coloured and blinking characters.
Uses ansi terminal escape sequences.
The '\033[' part is the escape code.
We pass '5;' for the colours other than green to make them blink.
The next part is the colour code and the 'm' ends the sequence.
To reset the colour we pass "\033[0m" after each character.
Python 3 version by antiloquax (2015), based on code from datamungeblog.com.
